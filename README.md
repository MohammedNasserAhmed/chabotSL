This repository contains a Streamlit app that uses OpenAI API and LangChain to generate natural language text. The app allows users to input a prompt and generate text based on that prompt using OpenAI's GPT-3 model and LangChain's language translation and correction services.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```
